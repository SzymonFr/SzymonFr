# About
I am a developer working with software development and game development. I am primarily proficient in .NET and C#, and I also have experience with java.
### Projects that I work with:
- WPF .NET
- MAUI .NET
- .NET libraries
- Unity
- Monogame
- SSMS databases
### Currently learning
- Blazor .NET
- Java
### What I am looking for and can offer + Extra
I am always looking for people who are willing to connect, need help or want to work on any projects together. I can offer myself as a contributor to any .NET projects on your mind.

I am especially proficient in the project types listed above, however I am very adaptable and I constantly learn and find solutions to any problem.

My github account is new, but I had many personal projects outside github - if you want to take a chance on me that would be great.
